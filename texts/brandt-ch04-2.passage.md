爭影
Quarrel about a Shadow

行人賃驢而行遠。
A traveller hired a donkey and went on a long journey.

天方暑。
The day just happened to be (very) hot.

覓蔭莫得。
(The traveller and the donkey-boy) looked for shade, (but) could not find (it).

乃伏於驢。腹之下以避日。
Then (they) crept under the donkey's belly in order to get shelter from the sun.

然驢腹僅蔽一人。驢夫與行人爭之。
But the donkey's belly could shelter only one man, and (therefore) the donkey-boy and the traveller (began to) quarrel about it.

驢夫曰。吾賃君驢。不賃君影。
The donkey-boy said, "I have hired out my donkey to you, but did not hire his shadow".

行人日吾以。錢賃驢。則影亦屬我。
The traveller said, "I have hired your donkey with money, and therefore his shadow also belongs to me".

語不相讓。鬪於驢下。
(They both) quarreled (lit. spoke) without yielding to each other, and came to blows under the donkey.

驢驚而逸。
The donkey took fright and ran away.

行人與驢夫共追之。不獲。懊喪而歸。
The traveller and the donkey-boy rushed after him but could not catch him, and returned in low spirits.

故曰。爭虛者喪其實。
For this reason it is said: "He who quarrels about nothing (lit. empty things) may lose something substantial."
