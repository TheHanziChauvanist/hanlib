Fortune-telling

卜者坐於四達之衢。爲行人語休咎。
A diviner was sitting at the cross-ways of four roads and was telling fortunes (lit. good luck, bad luck) for the passers-by.

忽其子奔告曰。
Suddenly his son ran up in haste and cried (lit. said),

吾家爲人所刧。家具盡。
"Our house has been robbed by somebody, (and) the household effects are all gone!"

喪卜者倉惶失措。
The fortune-teller was quite taken aback (by the news).

有調之者曰。
There was (someone) who wished to tease him (lit. teasing him) and said,

君日爲人語休咎。而家中凶兆顧不之省。何也。
"Every day you tell fortunes for others and yet you could not perceive an ill omen in (your own) house. How is that?

卜者不能對。
