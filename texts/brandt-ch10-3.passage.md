### 斷定字 The particles of definite judgment

The particles of definite judgment imply to the expressed judgments or conclusions a definite character. and are very similar to the expressions: of _course_, _naturally_, _certainly_, _surely_, _doubtless_ etc. for positive sentences, and to: _on no account_, _by no means_, _not in the least_, _not a bit_ etc. for negative sentences.

These particles are:

<center>`斷` `定` `决` `必` `實` `自` `絕` `並` `毫` `總` `終` `萬` `固`</center>
