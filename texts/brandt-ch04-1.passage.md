海大魚
The Sea-monster.

靖郭君爲齊相。
Ching Kuo-chün was a minister of the Ch'i state.

封於薛。
He was appointed to the fief of Hsüeh.

將城而居之。
There he intended to build walls and to live in that place.

客諫日。
(One of his) advisers said, admonishing him,

君不聞海大魚乎。
"Have you not heard about the sea-monster (lit. sea huge fish), sir?

網不能止。鈎不能牽。
A net cannot stop it, and it is impossible to haul it with a hook.

不幸失水。則螻蟻制焉。
(But if) unfortunately it is out of the water (lit. loses water), mole-crickets and ants would then (easily) master (it).

君之在齊。猶魚之在水也。
Your presence in Ch'i is similar to the abode of the sea-monster in water.

君若善治齊。
If you govern Ch'i in the proper way, Ch'i will become strong, and what sorrow could you have?

齊强。君又何憂焉。若一旦齊亡。雖築薛之城。使高於天。猶之無益也。
(But) if one day Ch'i perishes, (then) even if you should build (lit. cause) the walls of Hsüeh higher than the sky, still it would not be of any use to you."

靖郭君曰。善。乃不城薛。
"Good" said Ching Kuo-chün, and he did not build the walls in Hsüeh.
