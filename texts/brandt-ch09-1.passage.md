煤
Coal

物類之生也。植物先於動物。故上古之時。森林獨多。後經陵谷變遷。湮沒其中。積壓既人。遂成爲煤。與沙泥土相間。今人掘而用之。利莫大焉。煤色黑有光。質脆易碎。性耐久燃。非柴薪所可比。故凡用汽機者。無不賴於煤。我國多產煤之地。然礦學未興。故開探者尚少。夫天然之美利。我不自開。而待人爲我開之。遂使絕大利源爲外國所壟斷。誠可痛也。
Plants appeared upon the earth earlier than movable beings. Hence in remotest antiquity there were only thick forests everywhere. In the course of time after transformations of the surface of the earth, (those forests) were submerged and buried witbin the earth and there, under the continuous pressure (lit. as they had been accumulated and pressed for a long time) they changed into coal, lying between layers of sand, mud and earth. At the present time men dig out the coal and use it reaping enormous profits from it. The colour of coal is black with a lustre. It is brittle, easily splits and possesses the quality durable combustion out of comparison with fire-wood. On account of that all use of machinery (lit. all who use machinery) isdependent on coal. In our country there are many coal fields. But our mining is not yet developed, and therefore coal is still worked but little. Magnificent natural resources we do not exploit ourselves, but wait till others do it for us, and thus we allow the source of immense profit to be monopolized by foreigners. It is deplorable indeed!
