### THE INTENSIFYING-CONJUNCTIVE PARTICLES

The intensifying-conjunctive particles, like the conjunctive particles, serve to join individual words and sentences. And yet there is a considerable difference between these two groups. The intensifying-conjunctive particles are used when only one subject is discussed, and when the words that follow after an intensifying- conjunctive particle introduce a new quality of the subject or a new development of the matter in question. These particles can be translated by the expressions: "and also", "moreover", etc.

These particles are:

<center>`而` `且` `而且` `並` `又`</center>

#### Examples of using the intensifying-conjunctive particles:
