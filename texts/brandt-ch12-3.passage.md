晏嬰便楚
Yen-ying goes as Envoy to the Ch'u State

晏子使楚。晏子短。楚人爲小門於大。門之側。而延晏子。晏子不入。
曰。
Yen-tzu was sent as envoy to the Ch'u State. He was (very) short. The people of Ch'u had erected a small door beside the big gate, and asked Yen-tzu (to pass through it). But Yen-tzu refused to do it (lit. did not enter).

使至狗國者。從狗門入。今臣使楚。不當從此門。
"If I were sent as envoy to a dog country", he said, "I would have entered through the dog-gate. But I am sent to the Ch'u State, and it is not proper for me to pass through that gate."

儐者更從大門。
(Thereupon) the master of the ceremonies changed (his mind), and let him enter through the big gate.

入見楚王。楚王曰。齊無人耶。
When (Yen-tzu) saw the pce of Ch'u the latter asked him, "Has Ch'i no men?"

晏子對曰。齊之臨淄三百閭。張袂成帷。揮汗成雨。比肩接踵而在。何爲無人。
"(Our) Ch'i", replied Yen-tzu, "in the locality of Lin-tzu has three hundred villages. If our people were to open their sleeves, a (big) curtain could be made of them. If they were to wipe off their sweat, it would be like rain (lit. fornı rain). They are living very close to each other. How should one say, that Ch'i has no men !"

王曰。然則何爲使子。
"Why then did they send you ?" asked the prince.

晏子對曰。齊命便各有所主。其賢者使賢主。不肖者便不肖玉。嬰最不肖。故宜使楚耳。
"My sovereign (lit. Ch'i)", replied Yen-tzu, "when sending his envoys considers the worth of the princes. Virtuous men he sends to virtuous princes, and worthless ones to worthless princes. I am a very bad fellow, therefore I had to be sent to the Ch'u State."
