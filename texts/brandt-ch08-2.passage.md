死國
Death for the Father-land.

楚白公作亂。莊善辭其母。將往死之。
(When) Duke Po of the Ch'u State raised a rebellion, Chuang-shan bade farewell to his mother intending to go (to the place of the rebellion) and to die because of it.

其母曰。棄母而死可乎。
His mother said, "How can you leave your mother and die!"

對曰聞之爲臣者。內其祿而外其身。
"I have heard," replied (her son), "that the servants of the State enjoy (lit. within) their salary, and give away (lit. outside) (in exchange) their life (lit. body).

今所以養母者。國之祿也。食其祿而不死其事不可。
(The money) with which I support you (lit. mother) is the salary (I get) from the State. It is impossible to use its salary, and not to die for its cause".

乃命駕往。比至三嘆於車中。
And he ordered the chariot (to be ready) and went away. When (they) arrived, he sighed three times in his chariot.

其僕曰。子有所戀乎。
His servant asked, "Does master long for anybody?"

曰。念母耳。
"I remembered my mother", he replied.

其僕曰。然則何不返。
"Why then not turn back?" said the servant.

曰。念母私也。死國公也。君子不以私害公。
"To remember my mother is a private (matter)," he replied, "and to die for the father-land is a public (affair). The superior man will never on account of a private (matter) ruin a public (affair)."

卒與白公闘而死。
Finally he fought with duke Po and fell (lit. died).
