鴉
The Crow

老鴉渴甚見庭前有水壺欲飲之深水鴉竭力伸喙卒不得水仰首若有思忽飛去 銜石至投壺中往返十餘次石積水升鴉谒
A crow (was) very thirsty. She saw in front of a house a pot containing some water (lit. water pot) (and) wished to drink it (But) the pot was deep, (and) the water (in it) was shallow. The crow tried to stretch her beak as much as she could, but still could not get the water. (Then) she raised her head as if she were thinking. Suddenly she flew away (and)came back carrying a stone in her beak (which) she dropped into the pot. (Thus) she went and came back more than ten times. (When) the stones were piled up, the water had risen (and) then the crow quenched (her) thirst.
