多言無益
Uselessness of Many Words

或問墨子曰。
Someone asked Mo-tzu,

言以多爲貴乎。
"Is it from quantity that words become precious?"

墨子曰。蝦蟆日夜鳴。而人厭之。
Mo-tzu said, "Frogs croak day and night, yet men loathe them.

雄鷄一鳴。天下振動。
(But when) the cock crows (only) once, every thing (lit. under the sky) comes into motion.

言在當時。而已。
It is important to speak at the proper time, and that is all.

多言何。
What is the good of talking much?"
