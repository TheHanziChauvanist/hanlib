A 公使致外交總長函
A Letter from a Foreign Minister to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

逕啟者。前因本署某官。擬赴陝西遊歷。當由本公便函請貴總長。繕給護照一張。尙未動身。現接本國外交部電開。飭令該員。迅即回國。等因前來。進此。所有該員赴俠一舉。自應中止。茲將原領護照一紙送上。即希貴總長查照註銷可也。此泐。順頌時祉。
As an official of our Legation was intending to go into Shensi for travel, I sent a letter asking (lit. it was asked by me by letter) Your Excellency to have a passport prepared (for him). (But) before he started (lit. he has not yet started), a telegram was received from our Foreign Office ordering him to return home at once. Naturally the matter of the trip of the said official into Shensi must be dropped. Now, I beg to return the originally received passport which I hope Your Excellency will note and duly cancel. I avail myself, etc.

B 公使致外交總長函
A Letter from a Foreign Minister to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

逕啟者。日前本公使函送擬定通商新章。迄今數日。未蒙見覆。未知會否議定。盼念基切。爲此特請貴總長。將近日議定如何情形。速卽賜覆。以便轉覆本國外交部查照。是荷。專此布達。順頌日社。
At an earlier date I sent you by letter the newly fixed trade regulations. (Although) up to this time several days (have elapsed). I have not yet been honored with your reply and do not know whether any decision has been made (concerning the said regulations). Being very anxious about this matter I beg to especially request Your Excellency to let me know at your earliest convenience what are the conditions of your decision, in order that I may transmit your communication to our Foreign Office for their information. I avail myself, etc.
