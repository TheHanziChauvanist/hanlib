聊齋誌異 妖術
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - Magical Arts

于公者。少任俠喜。拳勇力。能持二壺。高作旋風舞。崇禎間。殿試在都。僕疫不起。患之。會市有善卜者。能决人生死。將代問之。既至。未言。卜者曰。君莫欲問僕病乎。公駭應之。曰。病者無害。君可危。公乃自卜。卜者起卦。愕然曰。君三日當死。公驚詫良久。卜者從容曰。鄙人有小術。報我十金。當代應之。公自念生死已定。術豈能解。不應而起。欲出。卜者曰。惜此小費。勿悔勿悔。愛公者皆爲公懼。勸罄橐以哀之。公不聽。倏忽至三日。公端坐旅舍。靜以視之。終日無恙。至夜。闔戶挑燈。倚劍危坐。一漏向盡。更無死法。
Mr. Yü in his youth was of heroic temperament and delighted in feats of strength. He was so strong that he could raise two copper kettles (of the clepsydra) above his head while he performed the whirlwind feat. During the reign of Ch'ung-Chen he was in the capital for the palace examinations. His servant became ill and was unable to rise, and Yü was very anxious about him. In the market-place there was a clever diviner who could forecast life and death, and Yü intended to ask him about his servant. When he came (to his place), before he had uttered a word, the diviner spoke, saying, "Were you not going to ask about your servant's illness, sir?" Yü was startled and acknowledged that he was. The diviner then said, "His illness is not serious, but you, sir, are in danger." Whereupon Yü wished to have his fortune told. The diviner cast his horoscope and in alarnı said, "Sir, in three days you must die!" Yü stood for a long time stunned and frightened, and the diviner quietly said, "I have a little skill in magic. If you will give me ten ounces of silver. I will break the evil spell." Yü reflected that life and death were predetermined, how then could any magic change the course of events (lit. to dispel). So he refused and started to go away. "You find it hard", said the diviner, "to part with this small sum, beware you do not repent later'". Yü's friends were all alarmed for him and urged him to empty his purse to beg the diviner's help. But Yü would not listen. The third day came quickly, and Yü was sitting in the inn waiting quietly and keeping close watch. Nothing happened to him the whole day, and at night-fall he closed the door, trimmed the lamp, and leaning on his sword sat and waited. The first watch was nearly gone, but still there was no sign of danger (lit. no way of death).
