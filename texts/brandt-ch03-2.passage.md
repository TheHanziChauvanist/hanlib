田仲
T'ien-chung.

齊有居士田仲者。
There was in the Ch'i state a retired scholar T'ien-chung (by name).

齊王養以厚祿。而不責以事。田仲安之。
The ruler of Ch'i paid (lit. supported) (him) a liberal salary, but did not entrust (him) with (any) work, and on account of that T'ien-chung felt himself quite at his ease.

屈榖往見而謂之曰。
Ch'ü-ku came to see (him) and said to him,

吾有匏。堅如石。厚而無竅。
"I have a bottle-gourd which is hard as a stone, and thick but has no cavity.

願獻之。
(I) wish to present it to you".

仲曰。所貴夫匏者。爲其可以盛也。
T'ien chung said, "One values the bottle-gourd for its use as a receptacle (lit. because it can contain things).

今厚而無竅。則不能剖以盛物。
Now (that gourd of yours) is thick but has no cavity; therefore it can not be made to hold things.

吾無所用之。
I have no need of it".

屈穀曰。今君仰人而食亦無益於人國。殆堅匏之類也。
Ch'ü-ku replied, "Living now at other people's expense you are also of no use to their state and (therefore) closely resemble the hard bottle-gourd (lit. nearly of the hard bottle-gourd class).
