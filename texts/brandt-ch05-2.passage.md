雹
Hail

秋日烈烈。暑熱未退。
An autumn day was very suitry, and the heat did not abate.

忽陰霾四布。大風驟至。
Suddenly (the sky) darkened on all sides, and a strong wind blew.

空中冰塊相擊。墮地有聲。
Small pieces of ice, josting each other in the air, poured down upon the earth with noise.

屋瓦檐鐵。砰磅聒耳。
The rattle (of hail) against the roof tiles and eaves bells was deafening.

一兒驚問曰。天方熱。何以有雪。
A boy was startled (by it) and asked (his father). "The day was just (so) hot, how (then) (can we) have snow?"

父曰。非雪也。是名爲雹。
His father said, "(It is) not snow; it is called hail".

兒曰。雹何自來。
"Where does hail come from?" asked the boy.

父曰。空中水汽將。成兩點。忽爲高處冷風所吹。驟結冰塊錯難下降。
The father said, "When water vapors, about to be transformed into rain drops, are suddenly exposed to a cold wind in the high zones (of the atmosphere), they instantly congeal into pieces of ice (which) fall down in disorder.

小者如豆。大者如雞卵。
The smaller ones are as big as peas, the large ones are of the size of a hen's egg.

害田禾。傷人畜。毀盧舍。往往成非常之災也。
(Hail) injures crops, hurts men and cattle, destroys huts and hovels, and very often causes emormous (lit. unusual) calamities."
