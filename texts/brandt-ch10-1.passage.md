腦
The Brain

古者以人之知覺皆本於心實則心爲發血之器而知覺之源蓋屬於腦腦體充塞頭顱上部有無數之神經達於全體猶電線之分布全國以互通其消息吾人有所動作則自腦傳令於神經以指揮百體猶總局傳電於分局也痛楚疴癢觸於肌膚聲色臭味接於耳目口鼻則神經傳其感覺以達於騰猶分局傳電於總局日間作事則腦力消耗夜必睡眠以補之童子腦體未充眠時宜多年長之人夜眠以八小時爲度
The ancients thought that man's perceptions originate in the heart. (But) in reality the heart is (only) an apparatus for distributing the blood, and the source of perceptions is in the brain. The brain substance fills the upper part of the head, and contains innumerable nerves which penetrate throughout the whole body as telegraph wires pass throughout the whole country fo the (mutual) transmission of news. (If) we have to make a move, then an order is given from the brain to the nerves for the direction of the mechanism of the body, the same as the head-office sends telegrams to the branch-offices. (Or) when our skin has a sensation of pain or itching or when our ears, eyes, mouth or nose receive a sound, color, taste or smell, our nerves transmit those sensations to the brain, the same as the branch-offices telegraph to the head-office. During the day's work we exhaust our brain's energy; therefore we must sleep at night in order to restore it. The child's brain is not completely formed, and (therefore) the period of sleep needs to be long. For the adults the night rest can be limited to eight hours.
