A peasant was selling pears in the market-place. They were very sweet and fragrant, (but) the price was very high. A Taoist priest in a ragged cap and coarse garments was begging before the cart. The peasant shouted at him (to get away), but he would not go. The peasant became angry and reviled him. The priest said, "On your cart you have several lhundred pears. and I only ask for one. It would be no great loss to you. Why then are you angry?" The onlookers urged the peasant to get rid of an inferior pear and let him go. But the peasant was obstinate and refused. The shopmen in the market-place seeing that the commotion was growing unbearable thereupon contributed a few cash, bought a pear and gave it to the priest. The priest bowed his thanks and said to the crowd, "We monks do not understand stinginess. I have here a very fine pear, let me present it to you." Some- body remarked, "Since you have it, why do you not eat it yourself? "I particularly wanted the seeds to plant them," he replied. Thereupon he seized the pear in both hands, took a large bite and finished it. He took the seeds in his hand, unfastened the pick from his shoulder, dug a hole several inches deep and put the seedsin, covering them over with earth. He (then) demanded of the market people some hot water with which to water (the seeds). Willing helpers detched some boiled water from a neighbouring roadside inn.
