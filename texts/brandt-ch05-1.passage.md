押忽大珠
A Ya-hu Pearl

西域買人。有奉珠求售於尚文者。索價六十萬。
A trader from western regions brought a pearl (which) he endeavoured to sell to Shang-wen asking (for it) 600,000 (ounces of silver).

識者曰。此所謂押忽大珠也。六十萬酬之。不爲過矣。
A connoisseur said, "It is the so-called Ya-hu great pearl. To pay 600,000 (for it) would not be too much."

一坐傳觀。爭以爲奇。
The whole company round looked at the pearl passing it and one after another recognized (lit. considered) (that it) was a wonderful (pearl).

文問日。此寶作何用。
"What is the use of this gem?" asked Shang-wen.

其人日。含之可不渴。
The other man said, "By keeping it in the mouth one can have no thirst."

文日。一人含之。十萬人不渴。則誠寶也。
Shang-wen said, "If one man kept it in the mouth, (so that) a hundred thousand men would not thirst, it would have been a gem indeed.

若一珠只濟一人。爲用已微矣。
(But) if one pearl (can) help only one man its utility then is insignificant.

吾之所謂寶者。米粟是也。
What I call a gem is rice.

一日不食則飢。三日不食則疾。七日不食則死。
One day without it makes one hungry; three days without it makes one ill; seven days without it makes one die.

有則百姓安。無則天下亂。
If there is rice, the people are quiet; if there is no rice, the country (lit. under the sky) revolts.

以功用較之。豈不愈於彼乎。
If we compare them in accordance with (their) utility, is it not better than the pearl?"
