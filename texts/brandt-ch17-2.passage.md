Interviewed the Foreign Minister of Netherlands(和外 部) yesterday.

二十一日電悉。修改稅則事。項晤外部。遵示切陳。伊初歸未能確答。嗣又商東方股長。據稱上年中政府所聲明。本部已接前函。惟此事庫便向未報到。事關商務。須經戶商二部研究。方可答復云。鏡。
Your telegram of the 21st instant was noted. Regarding the matter of Tariff revision I have just interviewed the Russian Foreign Minister and in accordance with your instructionsthoroughly explained it (to him). He having just returned from a trip could not reply definitely. Subsequently I consulted the Chief of the Department of Eastern Affairs, and he said that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received the Chinese Government's declaration of last year, but the matter had not yet been reported upon by Minister Kroupensky. As this affair is related to commerce, it must be considered by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce, and then a reply can be given. Liu-Ching-jen
